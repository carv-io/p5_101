// A comment!
// I can't write ANYTHING HERE WITH NO CONSEQUENCES!

// setup is where you do things like define your load up draw the main canvas or sketch
// and set up preliminary data structures.
// generally, for sketches that aren't animated, all of the functions will also live in setup
function setup() {

}

// the draw function is basically just a big loop where each cycle is known to be 60FPS (frames per second)
// the draw function can be seen as your "animation engine"
// there are ways to change the default frame rate, and control the animation flow.
// but generally all of those controls happen here
function draw() {

}
