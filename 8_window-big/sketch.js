// remember way back when when we started with just drawing the canvas
// those were the days!
// that was great, but for me,
// I like to use up the WHOLE window when I'm making pretty
// here's how that's done

function setup() {

  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight); // canvas fills entire width AND height of screen
  // createCanvas(windowWidth, 500); // canvas fills entire width of screen, but only part of the height
  background(50); // nice dark grey


}
