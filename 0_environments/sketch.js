// the P5.js library can be run with almost no "environment" setup,
// since JavaScript can be run as "client-side" code that is essentially "native" to the browser
// while there are also "server-side" JavaScript frameworks (the most famous being "Node.js")
// there is no need to configure or install a localhost or local server to run P5.js programs.

// to get started, simply download the complete library from here,
// https://p5js.org/download/
// Extract from the zip file
// Open the "p5/empty-example/sketch.js" file and start coding.
// to run this program, just open the "index.html" file in a browser

// AANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNDDDD

// if you like working in an IDE (code editor), Atom.io is a great free one.
// And it has a nice P5 Autocomplete editor called "p5xjs-autocomplete"
// https://atom.io/packages/p5xjs-autocomplete
// Or just search "p5" under Atom > Settings > Packages and install

// OOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR

// You don't actually even need to bother with the above(!)
// you can just go here https://editor.p5js.org/ and start coding!

// if you want to save your sketches, you would need to create an account.

// POLL - what would the group rather do?

// A. Work directly in the browser on editor.p5.org
// OR
// B. work on your local machines on Atom.io (or your own editors)?
